# SolBot Quality Filter Improvements

## üöÄ What's New?

Your bot has been **dramatically enhanced** with a sophisticated quality scoring system that filters out scams, rug pulls, and low-quality tokens to help you find **real gems** with 3x+ potential.

### Before vs After

**BEFORE:**
- ‚ùå Alerted on **every** new token (100% noise)
- ‚ùå Flooded with pump.fun scams (0.5 SOL liquidity)
- ‚ùå No quality checks = wasted time and money
- ‚ùå No security validation

**AFTER:**
- ‚úÖ **Quality Score System (0-100)** - only alerts on 70+ scores
- ‚úÖ **Smart Filtering** - rejects pump.fun, low liquidity, rug pulls
- ‚úÖ **Security Checks** - validates mint/freeze authority
- ‚úÖ **Market Cap Analysis** - targets $5k-$300k sweet spot
- ‚úÖ **Holder Distribution** - avoids whale-heavy tokens
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Alerts** - shows why a token is high quality

---

## üìä Quality Scoring Breakdown

Each token is scored out of 100 points across 4 categories:

### 1. **Liquidity (0-30 points)**
- **30 pts:** 15-100 SOL (optimal range for moonshots)
- **20 pts:** 10-15 SOL or 100-200 SOL (decent)
- **10 pts:** Other ranges within limits
- **REJECTED:** <10 SOL (scam) or >500 SOL (too high to pump)

### 2. **Market Cap (0-25 points)**
- **25 pts:** $5k-$300k (moonshot sweet spot)
- **15 pts:** $300k-$500k (decent upside potential)
- **5 pts:** <$5k (very high risk)
- **REJECTED:** >$500k (limited upside)

### 3. **Security (0-30 points)**
- **15 pts:** Mint authority revoked (can't print infinite tokens)
- **15 pts:** Freeze authority revoked (not a honeypot)
- **0 pts:** Authorities NOT revoked (‚ö†Ô∏è risk indicator)

### 4. **Holder Distribution (0-15 points)**
- **15 pts:** Top holder <30% (excellent distribution)
- **10 pts:** Top holder 30-50% (good)
- **5 pts:** Top holder 50-70% (moderate risk)
- **REJECTED:** Top holder >70% (rug pull risk)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide

All settings are in `bot/config.py` - **adjust these to match your risk tolerance:**

### Basic Settings (Start Here)

```python
# Minimum quality score to get alerts (70 is recommended)
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 70

# Liquidity range in SOL
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 10    # Too low = scam
MAX_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 500   # Too high = hard to pump

# Sweet spot for best scores
OPTIMAL_LIQUIDITY_MIN = 15   # Ideal minimum
OPTIMAL_LIQUIDITY_MAX = 100  # Ideal maximum

# Market cap range in USD
MARKET_CAP_MIN = 5_000        # $5k minimum
MARKET_CAP_MAX = 300_000      # $300k for best score
MARKET_CAP_UPPER_LIMIT = 500_000  # Hard limit
```

### Advanced Settings

```python
# Security requirements (False = optional, True = mandatory)
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = False    # Set True for max safety
REQUIRE_FREEZE_REVOKED = False  # Set True to avoid honeypots

# Holder concentration
MAX_TOP_HOLDER_PERCENTAGE = 70  # Reject if top holder owns more

# Filter pump.fun tokens (highly recommended)
FILTER_PUMP_FUN_TOKENS = True

# Current SOL price for market cap calculations
SOL_PRICE_USD = 200  # Update this regularly
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Configurations

### Conservative (Safer, Fewer Alerts)

Best for minimizing risk and focusing on established tokens:

```python
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 80
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 20
MAX_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 300
MARKET_CAP_MIN = 10_000
MARKET_CAP_MAX = 200_000
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = True
REQUIRE_FREEZE_REVOKED = True
MAX_TOP_HOLDER_PERCENTAGE = 50
```

### Balanced (Default)

Good mix of opportunity and risk management:

```python
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 70
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 10
MAX_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 500
MARKET_CAP_MIN = 5_000
MARKET_CAP_MAX = 300_000
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = False
REQUIRE_FREEZE_REVOKED = False
MAX_TOP_HOLDER_PERCENTAGE = 70
```

### Aggressive (More Risk, More Opportunities)

For finding very early tokens with high risk/reward:

```python
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 60
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 5
MAX_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 500
MARKET_CAP_MIN = 2_000
MARKET_CAP_MAX = 500_000
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = False
REQUIRE_FREEZE_REVOKED = False
MAX_TOP_HOLDER_PERCENTAGE = 80
```

## üìà Trading Strategy Tips

### When You Get an Alert:

1. **Quick Analysis (30 seconds)**
   - Check DexScreener chart - look for organic growth
   - Verify holder distribution on Solscan
   - Check social media (Twitter/TG) for community

2. **Entry Strategy**
   - Enter within **first 5-10 minutes** of alert
   - Use small position sizes (1-2% of portfolio per token)
   - Set stop loss at -30% to -50%

3. **Exit Strategy**
   - Take 50% profit at 2x
   - Take 30% profit at 3x
   - Let 20% ride with trailing stop loss
   - **Maximum hold time: 5-6 hours** (as you requested)

4. **Risk Management**
   - Never invest more than you can afford to lose
   - Diversify across multiple tokens
   - Track your win rate and adjust settings
   - If getting too many alerts, increase MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Too Many Alerts?

**Increase filtering strictness:**
```python
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 80  # Raise from 70
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 15      # Raise from 10
REQUIRE_MINT_REVOKED = True # Require security checks
```

### Too Few Alerts?

**Decrease filtering strictness:**
```python
MINIMUM_QUALITY_SCORE = 60  # Lower from 70
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 5       # Lower from 10
MAX_LIQUIDITY_SOL = 1000    # Raise from 500
```

### Not Catching Any Tokens?

Check these common issues:
1. **RPC connection** - Ensure Helius API key is valid
2. **Telegram bot** - Verify bot token and chat ID in `.env`
3. **Filters too strict** - Try Aggressive config temporarily
4. **Market conditions** - Fewer new tokens launch during bear markets

### Getting Pump.fun Tokens?

```python
# Ensure this is enabled:
FILTER_PUMP_FUN_TOKENS = True
```

---

## üìä Performance Tracking

Monitor these metrics in your console:

```
‚ö° Stats: Detected 100 | Filtered 92 | Alerted 8
```

- **Detected:** Total new pools found
- **Filtered:** Rejected due to low quality
- **Alerted:** High-quality gems sent to Telegram

**Good ratio:** 90-95% filtered (means filters are working!)

---

## üéì Understanding the Scores

### What is a "Good" Token?

**Score 70-79 (Good):**
- Decent liquidity and market cap
- Some security measures in place
- Reasonable holder distribution
- Worth investigating

**Score 80-89 (Excellent):**
- Optimal liquidity for pumping
- Strong security (revoked authorities)
- Good holder distribution
- High probability of success

**Score 90-100 (Elite):**
- Perfect liquidity range
- All security checks passed
- Excellent distribution
- Rare, but highest potential

### Why Some Tokens Score Low

Common reasons for rejection:

1. **Pump.fun tokens** - 99% are scams
2. **Low liquidity** (<10 SOL) - can't enter/exit easily
3. **High top holder** (>70%) - rug pull risk
4. **Too high market cap** - limited upside potential
5. **No security measures** - infinite mint = disaster

---

## üîÑ Daily Maintenance

### Update SOL Price

Check current SOL price and update in `config.py`:

```python
SOL_PRICE_USD = 200  # Update to current price
```

This affects market cap calculations.

### Review Performance

Every few days, review your alerts:
- Are they hitting 3x within 6 hours?
- Too many false positives? Increase score threshold
- Missing opportunities? Decrease score threshold

### Adjust Thresholds

Based on market conditions:
- **Bull market:** More tokens = stricter filters (score 75-80)
- **Bear market:** Fewer tokens = looser filters (score 60-65)

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify `.env` file has correct API keys
3. Test RPC connection: `curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY`
4. Review recent code changes in git
